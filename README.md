# Code Quiz

## Description

Integrating Javascript into a website or application adds a whole new way for users to engage with the content in that website or application. It enhances functionality by introducing dynamic elements to an otherwise static page, which makes a much more interesting user experience overall.

This project is an interactive quiz that allows users to test their knowledge with questions about Javascript basics. Players have 60 seconds to answer the questions. For every incorrect choice, a penalty of 5 seconds applies to the timer. The faster the player completes the quiz, the better their score — provided, of course, that were no incorrect choices!
